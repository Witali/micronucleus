# Measured size reductions

All measurements use no LED at BOOT_AT0x1A40. Receiver qualification remains open.

## Reuse EP0 SETUP validation in foreground

Reuse the existing received-length and token validator instead of repeating its length check. This saves six bytes; the valid-SETUP path retains its timing. Non-SETUP service adds seven cycles, covered by the real-IN polling test.

Measured image: 1402 bytes.
